Printer Information
===================
Modified for use on the KLD series of printers, should work on the 1260 and 2150 as well as clones. No guarantee that it will work on any other printers. It will not work as is on the Wanhao Duplicator 7.

All of the direct DLP control for the mUVeDLP printers will not be pertinent to these printers so all the added M65x commands have been purged from the source code.

-Marlin Firmware-
Marlin has a GPL license because I believe in open development.
Please do not use this code in products (3D printers, CNC etc) that are closed source or are crippled by a patent.

Quick Information
===================
This RepRap firmware is a mashup between <a href="https://github.com/kliment/Sprinter">Sprinter</a>, <a href="https://github.com/simen/grbl/tree">grbl</a> and many original parts.


The normal default baudrate is 250000. This baudrate has less jitter and hence errors than the usual 115200 baud, but is less supported by drivers and host-environments.
Since nanoDLP does not support 250000, 115200 is used as the default instead.

Differences and additions to the already good Sprinter firmware:
================================================================

*Look-ahead:*

Marlin has look-ahead. While sprinter has to break and re-accelerate at each corner,
lookahead will only decelerate and accelerate to a velocity,
so that the change in vectorial velocity magnitude is less than the xy_jerk_velocity.
This is only possible, if some future moves are already processed, hence the name.
It leads to less over-deposition at corners, especially at flat angles.

*EEPROM:*

If you know your PID values, the acceleration and max-velocities of your unique machine, you can set them, and finally store them in the EEPROM.
After each reboot, it will magically load them from EEPROM, independent what your Configuration.h says.

*LCD Menu:*

If your hardware supports it, you can build yourself a LCD-CardReader+Click+encoder combination. It will enable you to realtime tune temperatures,
accelerations, velocities, flow rates, select and print files from the SD card, preheat, disable the steppers, and do other fancy stuff.
One working hardware is documented here: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:12663
Also, with just a 20x4 or 16x2 display, useful data is shown.

*SD card folders:*

If you have an SD card reader attached to your controller, also folders work now. Listing the files in pronterface will show "/path/subpath/file.g".
You can write to file in a subfolder by specifying a similar text using small letters in the path.
Also, backup copies of various operating systems are hidden, as well as files not ending with ".g".

*SD card folders:*

If you place a file auto[0-9].g into the root of the sd card, it will be automatically executed if you boot the printer. The same file will be executed by selecting "Autostart" from the menu.
First *0 will be performed, than *1 and so on. That way, you can heat up or even print automatically without user interaction.

*Endstop trigger reporting:*

If an endstop is hit while moving towards the endstop, the location at which the firmware thinks that the endstop was triggered is outputed on the serial port.
This is useful, because the user gets a warning message.
However, also tools like QTMarlin can use this for finding acceptable combinations of velocity+acceleration.
